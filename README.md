## Business Understanding

In today's dynamic landscape of online seafood retail, businesses encounter several challenges related to consumer preferences, accessibility, and promoting healthy eating habits. With the increasing demand for convenient shopping experiences and diverse dietary choices, addressing these challenges becomes imperative for ensuring customer satisfaction and fostering a sustainable business model üêü.

One of the primary concerns revolves around ensuring accessibility to seafood products for consumers, particularly those residing in landlocked areas or areas with limited access to fresh seafood markets. Additionally, promoting seafood consumption among children, who often exhibit reluctance towards seafood due to taste preferences or lack of exposure, poses a significant challenge. By understanding these obstacles, businesses can tailor their offerings and marketing strategies to cater to diverse consumer needs and preferences.

The proposed solution involves developing a personalized recommendation system for the online seafood shop, Manettas, using Content-Based Filtering techniques. By leveraging product descriptions, pricing information, and origin details, the system aims to provide tailored recommendations to users based on their preferences and previous purchase history. This solution not only enhances the shopping experience for customers by offering relevant and enticing product suggestions but also encourages seafood consumption by showcasing a variety of high-quality and sustainably sourced seafood options ü¶ê.
